#                      If on a cluster, you should set this manually until
#                      ingress(es) are implemented. Example:
#                      http://myserver.fqdn:24816
  # PostrgreSQL container settings for user accounts

#   username: pulp

  # Configuration for the persistentVolumeClaim for /var/lib/pulp
# pulp_file_storage:
     # If your K8s cluster is only 1 node, and its StorageClass /
     # provisioner does not support ReadWriteMany, then you must change
     # this to "ReadWriteOnce".
     #
     # If your K8s cluster is multiple nodes, and does not support
     # ReadWriteMany, then pulp-operator is currently incompatible.
     #
     # Reference on which support ReadWriteMany:
     # https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes
#      access_mode: "ReadWriteMany"

     # How much space do you want to give Pulp for storing content under
     # /var/lib/pulp ?

     # For reference, epel7 x86_64 is currently (2019-07) 30G. So 100G
     # should be sufficient for a test deployment with only the RPM
     # content plugin.
