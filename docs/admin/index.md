# Welcome to Pulp Operator!

## Overview

Pulp Operator allows to manage services in an automated way by implementing the human operator knowledge
into code (see [The Operator Pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)).

It is in beta stage and under active development, with the goal to provide a scalable and robust cluster for Pulp 3.
If you find any problem, please check our [issue page](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ago-alpha) with the current known issues or feel free to fill a new bug or rfe in case it is not addressed yet.

If you just got here, you may want to take our
[Quickstart with Kubernetes](site:pulp-operator/docs/admin/tutorials/quickstart-kubernetes/) tutorial to get your first instance up and running.
We also recommended that you read the [Basic Concepts](site:pulp-operator/docs/admin/learn/basic-concepts/)
section before diving into the workflows and reference material.
