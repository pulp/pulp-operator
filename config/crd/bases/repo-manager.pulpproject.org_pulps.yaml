                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3

                          terminate gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period
                          is the duration in seconds after the processes running in
                          the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when
                          the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set
                          this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your
                          process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds
                          will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value
                          provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer.
                          The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal
                          (no opportunity to shut down). This is a beta field and
                          requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                          Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is
                          used if unset.

                            is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                            as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                            cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3
